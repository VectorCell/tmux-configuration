# tmux-configuration

A set of configuration files and scripts for tmux.

tmux.conf should be linked to as ~/.tmux.conf
all tmux-* scripts should be in the user's path

The install.sh script will place a link to tmux.conf in the user's home directory, and the scripts starting with "tmux-" will be linked to in the user's private bin directory, if it exists at ~/bin.
